# Outliers Detection Dashboard

## Backgrounds
Hey, this is Luke. At the time I am writing this readme. I am a data scientist intern working at Bayer and looking for a full time job after I officially graduate at November 2021.

I am a believer that data analysis should be a simple skill just as breathing for everyone. Those beliefs combined with a challenge from Shopify internship application end up this project. 

This dashboard could replace a whole data analysis project about outliers detection. In another word, anyone could use this dashboard to do a data analysis, detect the outliers and made conclusions with in 5 mins. Also the dashboard is interactive and it is so simple, that you should able to work with it without any introduction. If it is not, please open an issue ticket and I will make it so.

About the implementation, I designed it using different modules so it should be ablt to fit your needs very easily.

Other than that, please give it a star if you like it or it helps your project somehow. If you think there could be some improvements can be done, please open an issue ticket or create a pull request.
