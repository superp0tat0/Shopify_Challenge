## Backgrounds

Hey, this is Luke. At the time I am writing this readme. I am a data scientist intern working at Bayer and looking for a full time job after I officially graduate at November 2021.

I did this project with the engagement of my daily work and one data scienctist challenge related to data scientist position from Shopify. To demonstrate the importance of the reusability for data science project. I implement this dashboad and would like to share my belief.

## Motivations

I am a believer that data analysis should be a simple skill just as breathing for everyone. Moreover, data scientists should deliver solution instead of reports to their stakeholders with minimum education required.
This dashboard could replace a whole data analysis project about outliers detection. In another word, anyone could use this dashboard to do a data analysis, detect the outliers and made conclusions with in 5 mins. Also the dashboard is interactive and it is so simple, that you should able to work with it with little introduction.

## Object

Assume there are some Shopify sneaker shops are generating transactions data. However, one of the metric, Averge Order Value (AOV) is too high with 3156.54$. The question is asking the candidates why this is the case and how could you come up the better metrics, and the reasons to choose those metrics.

## Panel Functions

## Proposed Steps

Although I think it would be fun to tackle the dashboard yourself. But for the analysis steps. You could check

## Future Plan

About the implementation, I designed it using different modules so it should be ablt to fit your needs very easily.

Other than that, please give it a star if you like it or it helps your project somehow. If you think there could be some improvements can be done, please open an issue ticket or create a pull request.
